    // employee->tellCompany(); // ERROR


    // one could've have accessed the objects of the derived classes with the references of the derived classes as well, in that CASE, we won't have to use the virtual keyword. // for ex: below:
    Employee *new_emp = new Employee("idk","junior",1000);

    // Method HIDING
    new_emp->sayHi();
